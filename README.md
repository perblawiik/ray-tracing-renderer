# Monte Carlo Ray Tracing Renderer

An attempt of making a photo realistic global illumination renderer made from scratch in C++.
The illumination model is based on path tracing with Monte Carlo integration and supports perfectly reflective/refractive 
surfaces aswell as Lambertian and Oren-Nayar diffuse surfaces.
